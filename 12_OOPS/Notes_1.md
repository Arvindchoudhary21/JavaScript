# javascript and classes

do javascript has classes?

Yes, JavaScript has a class syntax that was introduced with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). This syntax provides a more structured and familiar way to work with constructor functions and prototypes, making it resemble class-based object-oriented languages. However, it's important to understand that under the hood, JavaScript's class system is still based on prototypes.

so it means that ki javascript is not a class based object oriented language because ye prototype based
language hai 

but ye class wala syntax jarur provide krta hai taki programmers jo c++ ya java se shift ho rhe hai
onko koi problem na ho

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming where classes are not present, and behavior reuse (or inheritance in class-based languages) is performed by cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes.
